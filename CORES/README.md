## üìÑ CORES: Convolutional Response-based Score for Out-of-distribution Detection

This provides a Pytorch implementation of: [CORES: Convolutional Response-based Score for Out-of-distribution Detection](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024/html/Tang_CORES_Convolutional_Response-based_Score_for_Out-of-distribution_Detection_CVPR_2024_paper.html)

## ‚öôÔ∏è About

The CORES method leverages convolutional response statistics to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. This implementation aims to reproduce and explore the core ideas proposed in the paper.
